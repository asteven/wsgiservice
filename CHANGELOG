    * routing.py (Router._compile): Use extensions defined by resource in
      EXTENSION_MAP dictionary instead of the hardcoded list of '.xml' and
      '.json'.

    * resource.py: Change EXTENSION_MAP to a list instead of a dictionary, so
      we can rely on the order of entries. Breaks backwards-compatibility for
      resources with a custom EXTENSION_MAP.
