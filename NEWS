Summary of the important changes per WsgiService release. To get the full
history use the commit log.


0.2.1: July 15, 2009
    - Routing: Use extensions defined by resource in EXTENSION_MAP dictionary
      instead of the hardcoded list of '.xml' and '.json'.
    - Resource: Change EXTENSION_MAP to a list instead of a dictionary, so we
      can rely on the order of entries. Breaks backwards-compatibility for
      resources with a custom EXTENSION_MAP.
    - Resource: Remove hard-coded setting of Content-Type and Content-MD5
      response headers. Move into a new generic method set_response_headers
      which in turn calls the two methods set_response_content_type and
      set_response_content_md5. This allows for easier overwriting in
      subclasses.
    - Resource: Output valid XML when serializing lists. Each child is now
      <child order="N"> instead of just <N> (where N is the array index).
    - Help resource: Sort the resources by name, mark parameters with
      validation rules as mandatory.
    - Documentation: Add a lot of additional documentation. Document the
      current state of HTTP implementation.
